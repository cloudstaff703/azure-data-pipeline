# azure-data-pipeline
This project demonstrates how to build a data pipeline using Python and various Azure services. The pipeline extracts data from a public API, transforms it, and then loads it into an Azure SQL Database. Azure Functions are used to automate the pipeline, and Azure Storage is used to store raw and processed data.
